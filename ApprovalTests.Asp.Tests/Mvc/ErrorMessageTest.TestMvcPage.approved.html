Exception Thrown on Server.
If this is a 'View not Found' the most likely reason is your ActionResult is being calculated incorrectly. 

There are 2 ways to fix this.
1) Instead of extending Controller, extend ControllerWithExplicitViews
For Example:
   (wrong) ExampleController : Controller
   (right) ExampleController : ControllerWithExplicitViews
or 

2) add .Explicit() to your ViewResult

For Example:
 (wrong) return View();
 (right) return View().Explicit();

Message: The view 'TestIndex' or its master was not found or no view engine supports the searched locations. The following locations were searched:
~/Views/NonExplicit/TestIndex.aspx
~/Views/NonExplicit/TestIndex.ascx
~/Views/Shared/TestIndex.aspx
~/Views/Shared/TestIndex.ascx
~/Views/NonExplicit/TestIndex.cshtml
~/Views/NonExplicit/TestIndex.vbhtml
~/Views/Shared/TestIndex.cshtml
~/Views/Shared/TestIndex.vbhtml
